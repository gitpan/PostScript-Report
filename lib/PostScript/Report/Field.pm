=head1 DESCRIPTION

This L<Component|PostScript::Report::Role::Component> is a simple text field.

C<font> to draw the text, not C<label_font>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

A Field has all the normal
L<component attributes|PostScript::Report::Role::Component/ATTRIBUTES>,
including C<padding_bottom>, C<padding_side>, and C<value>.
