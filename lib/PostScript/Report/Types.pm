=head1 NAME

PostScript::Report::Types - type library for PostScript::Report

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.11 of
PostScript::Report::Types, released May 4, 2013
as part of PostScript-Report version 0.12.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These are the custom types used by L<PostScript::Report>.

=head1 TYPES

=head2 BorderStyle

A valid border style (C<0>, C<1>, or any combination of C<T>, C<B>,
C<L>, and C<R>).  Will be forced into canonical form.

=head2 Color

This is a number in the range 0 to 1 (where 0 is black and 1 is
white), or an arrayref of three numbers C<[ Red, Green, Blue ]> where
each number is in the range 0 to 1.

In addition, you can specify an RGB color in the HTML hex triplet form
prefixed by C<#> (like C<#FFFF00> or C<#FF0> for yellow).

=head2 Component

An object that does L<PostScript::Report::Role::Component>.

=head2 Container

An object that does L<PostScript::Report::Role::Container>.

=head2 FontObj

A L<PostScript::Report::Font>.

=head2 FontMetrics

A L<PostScript::File::Metrics>.

=head2 HAlign

C<center>, C<left>, or C<right>

=head2 Report

A L<PostScript::Report>.

=head2 RptValue

Something you can pass to L<PostScript::Report/get_value>.
A string or an object that does L<PostScript::Report::Role::Value>.

=head2 Parent

An object that is a suitable C<parent> for a Component.

=head2 VAlign

C<bottom> or C<top>

=head1 SEE ALSO
