=head1 NAME

PostScript::Report::Role::Value - Something that returns a field value

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.01 of
PostScript::Report::Role::Value, released October 29, 2009
as part of PostScript-Report version 0.04.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Value role describes an object that provides a C<get_value>
method.  It's used as the L<PostScript::Report::Role::Component/value>
when something more than a simple hash or array lookup is required.
See L<PostScript::Report/get_value>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 get_value

  $value = $value_object->get_value($report)

A Value must provide this method.  It returns the value that should be
displayed on the report.  It may consult the C<$report> object to
collect information.


=head2 dump

  $value_object->dump($level)

This method (for debugging purposes only) prints a representation of
the value to the currently selected filehandle.

C<$level> indicates the level of indentation to use.

The default implementation should be sufficient in most cases.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

No bugs have been reported.
