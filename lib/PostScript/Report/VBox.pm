=head1 NAME

PostScript::Report::VBox - Hold components in a vertical column

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.04 of
PostScript::Report::VBox, released May 5, 2011
as part of PostScript-Report version 0.09.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This L<Container|PostScript::Report::Role::Container> draws its
children in a vertical column.  There is no space between children.
If the children are of different widths, they are all left aligned.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

A VBox has all the normal
L<container attributes|PostScript::Report::Role::Container/ATTRIBUTES>.

During layout calculations, a VBox temporarily sets its C<height> to
its C<row_height> (so that its children will inherit that value).
After the children have done their layout calculations, any child
without an explicit height has its height set to the VBox's C<row_height>.

If C<height> is not specified, then the VBox's height is set to the
sum of the heights of the child components.  If the VBox did have an
explicit C<height>, then it is restored after the children have
completed their layout calculations.

If C<width> is not specified, but any child has an explicit width,
then the VBox's width is set to the width of the widest such child.
Otherwise, the width remains unset.

If you specify a height that is more than the sum of the children's
heights, the extra space will appear at the bottom of the box.

If you specify a height that is less than the sum of the children's
heights, the children will overflow the bottom of the box, which
may lead to components printing on top of each other.
