=head1 NAME

PostScript::Report::Image - Include an EPS file

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.06 of
PostScript::Report::Image, released March 26, 2010
as part of PostScript-Report version 0.06.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This L<Component|PostScript::Report::Role::Component> allows you to
include an EPS file in your report.  Most vector-based drawing
programs can save in EPS format.  You can also convert bitmap images
to EPS using a program like ImageMagick (L<http://www.imagemagick.org>),
but vector-based formats will generally give you better quality and
smaller files.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

An Image has all the normal
L<component attributes|PostScript::Report::Role::Component/ATTRIBUTES>,
including C<padding_bottom> and C<padding_side>.

If you specify C<height> but not C<width> (or vice versa), the missing
attribute is calculated based on the image's size, the attribute you
did provide, and the C<scale>.

If you specify neither C<height> nor C<width>, then both are
calculated based on the image size and the C<scale>.

C<align> controls the horizontal alignment of the image.  (Unless it
was unable to find the BoundingBox of the EPS file, in which case left
alignment is forced.)

=for Pod::Coverage BUILD draw



=head2 file

The name of the file to include.  If you give a relative path, it will
be converted to an absolute path.  Required.


=head2 scale

This is the factor by which the image will be scaled.  If you supply
an explicit C<height> and/or C<width>, but no C<scale>, then the scale
will be calculated to make the image fit in the specified dimensions
(based on the BoundingBox in the EPS file).  Otherwise, the scale
defaults to 1 (actual size).  Numbers greater than 1 make the image larger.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Since it is non-trivial to turn an EPS file into a PostScript
procedure, the image file is included every time the component is
drawn.  This is no problem when the image appears only once in a
report header or footer, but an image in a page header or footer can
significantly increase the file size.
