=head1 NAME

PostScript::Report::Font - Represents a PostScript font

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.06 of
PostScript::Report::Font, released May 5, 2011
as part of PostScript-Report version 0.09.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

PostScript::Report::Font represents a font in a L<PostScript::Report>.
You won't deal directly with Font objects unless you are writing your
own L<Components|PostScript::Report::Role::Component>.

You construct a Font object by calling the report's
L<PostScript::Report/get_font> method.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 font

This is the PostScript name of the font to use.


=head2 id

This is the PostScript identifier for the scaled font (assigned by the
document).


=head2 metrics

This is a L<PostScript::File::Metrics> object providing information
about the dimensions of the font.


=head2 size

This is the size of the font in points.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 width

  $font->width($text)

This returns the width of C<$text> (in points) if it were printed in
this font.  C<$text> should not contain newlines.


=head2 wrap

  @lines = $font->wrap($width, $text)

This wraps C<$text> into lines of no more than C<$width> points.  If
C<$text> contains newlines, they will also cause line breaks.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

PostScript::Report::Font requires no configuration files or environment variables.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

No bugs have been reported.
