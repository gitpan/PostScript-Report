=head1 NAME

PostScript::Report::HBox - Hold components in a horizontal row

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.01 of
PostScript::Report::HBox, released February 26, 2010
as part of PostScript-Report version 0.05.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This L<Container|PostScript::Report::Role::Container> draws its
children in a horizontal row.  There is no space between children.
If the children are of different heights, their tops are aligned.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

An HBox has all the normal
L<container attributes|PostScript::Report::Role::Container/ATTRIBUTES>.

If C<height> is not specified, but any child has an explicit height,
then the HBox's height is set to the height of the tallest such child.
Otherwise, the height remains unset.

If C<width> is not specified, then it is set to the sum of the widths
of the child components.  Each child must have an explicit width.

If you specify a width that is more than the sum of the children's
widths, the extra space will appear at the right side of the box.

If you specify a width that is less than the sum of the children's
widths, the children will overflow the right side of the box, which
may lead to components printing on top of each other.
