CHANGES
    Here's what's new in version 0.12 of PostScript::Report:
    (See the file "Changes" for the full revision history.)

	- No functional changes; just updated metadata
	- Add Moose & MooseX::Types to configure_requires.
	  They're not actually required by Makefile.PL, but if they're
	  not installed, it skips the version check introduced in
	  version 0.11.  Since many CPAN testers don't install modules
	  normally, but just build an @INC containing only the listed
	  requirements, they always skipped the version check and
	  continued to send reports for that Moose bug.
