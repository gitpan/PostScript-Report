CHANGES
    Here's what's new in version 0.07 of PostScript::Report:
    (See the file "Changes" for the full revision history.)

	- Added extra_styles & get_style, which allows Components to
	  inherit attributes without Containers and the Report needing
	  to know every possible attribute
	- Removed label_font from Report & Component
	  (It's only used by FieldTL, and can be handled by extra_styles.)
