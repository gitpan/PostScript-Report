CHANGES
    Here's what's new in version 0.11 of PostScript::Report:
    (See the file "Changes" for the full revision history.)

	- Clean up type library
	- Warn about conflict between MooseX::Types 0.32 and greater
	  with Moose versions before 2.0800 (fixes RT#77299)
	- Stabilize order of font creation.  Didn't affect printed
	  output, but generated code could be different between runs,
	  causing test failures on Perl 5.17.
